# understory

A constructive tool for creating interactive multimedia stories.

When digital video was first developed in the 1980s, researchers understood the medium's future was interactivity. Early frameworks like HyperCard and QuickTime enabled artists to create entire worlds out of digital video and pre-rendered computer graphics. Since that time, interactive video and multimedia has been all but abandoned in favor of realtime 3D, because of the rapid proliferation of consumer graphics cards. All of us at Rain love realtime 3D and the incredible experiences it has enabled, but to be honest, the state of digital video in the 2020s feels deeply tragic. The dream of interactivity has been either totally forgotten or relegated to one-off highly linear choose-your-own adventure style experiences that feel more like a DVD menu than something truly meaningful. While platforms like YouTube and TikTok have enabled millions of creators to express themselves, they force artists to produce formulaic content to conform to algorithms and satisfy sponsors. The understory engine is our humble attempt at bringing interactivity back to digital video, enabling artists around the world to express themselves through the limitless medium of multimedia for free forever.

**understory** is powered by the fantastic Qt library and the Python programming language, enabling support for a wide variety of video codecs and image formats. We want to keep it as artist friendly as possible, although some Python knowledge will enable you to make full use of the tool. As with every piece of software we make at Rain, understory's editor is designed with a vibrant, moody, *living interface* to evoke a creative, emotional mindset in the artist. As much as this is a tool, it is also a deeply personal form of artistic expression and may defy some of the interface conventions you might be used to in other tools. 

# Requirements

Releases will include all necessary packages but if you're working with the source code itself, you will need the following additional Python packages:

○ PySide6

# Feature Goals

**understory** is in the very early days of developement with most of the work still ahead. Here are some of the things we'd like to be able to do with the engine (and the editor!):

○ Photorealistic pre-rendered adventure games

○ Real-time day/night cycles

○ Autonomous entities that can follow a schedule and make decisions

○ Contextual gameplay

○ Video albums

○ Kiosks/Installations
